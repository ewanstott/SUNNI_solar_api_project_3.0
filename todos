To Do List:

add data layer

1. First priorty is ALWAYS to get data working on the console

- Add some sort of 'to do app' features i.e. ability to sort or something (look at other projects) - ask Jon/Russell for ideas also

- contact Google - add solar data layer
- try using weather geocode API -> convert lat and lon to address
- make front end cards for stats

Feature Ideas:

Building a solar panel checker tool is a great initiative! Here are some feature ideas you might consider adding to enhance its functionality and user experience:

Location-based Solar Potential:
Provide information about the solar potential at the user's specific location. Consider integrating with APIs or databases that offer solar radiation data for different regions.

3D Roof Visualization:
Allow users to visualize solar panel placement on their roofs in 3D. This could help them understand how shading, orientation, and tilt might affect energy production.

Cost Estimation:
Integrate a cost estimation feature that factors in the user's location, roof size, and local solar panel installation costs. Provide a breakdown of costs, potential savings, and return on investment.

Carbon Footprint Reduction:
Calculate and display the estimated reduction in carbon footprint based on the energy generated by the solar panels.

Energy Storage Recommendations:
Offer suggestions for energy storage solutions, such as batteries, based on the user's energy consumption patterns and local electricity grid conditions.

Government Incentives and Rebates:
Provide information on available government incentives, tax credits, and rebates for solar installations in the user's area.

Real-time Monitoring:
Allow users to monitor their solar panel system's performance in real-time, including energy production, consumption, and any issues with the system.

Weather Forecast Integration:
Integrate weather forecast data to provide users with predictions on how weather conditions might impact their solar panel efficiency in the coming days.

Community Comparison:
Enable users to compare their solar panel system's performance with others in their community, fostering a sense of community and friendly competition.

Maintenance Alerts:
Implement a system that sends users alerts for regular maintenance checks and provides tips on how to keep their solar panels operating efficiently.

Educational Resources:
Include educational content, such as articles, videos, or guides, to help users understand the basics of solar energy, how solar panels work, and how to optimize their systems.

Mobile App Integration:
Create a mobile app version of your tool for on-the-go access, notifications, and easy monitoring.

Social Sharing:
Allow users to share their solar panel system performance or achievements on social media, encouraging environmental awareness and engagement.

User Accounts and Profiles:
Implement user accounts to save preferences, track historical data, and personalize recommendations based on their usage patterns.
